# Sqlite-based-Web-App
This is the web app using Sqlite instead of mySQL for testing purpose

Whatâ€™s more to be done:

1. upgrade the framework, apply CSS and JS
2. change the img url text field into browse button and allow user upload file
3. simplify everything
4. create launch.sh to allow apps run in AWS
5. test documentation
